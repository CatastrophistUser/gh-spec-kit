# Implementation Plan: Pokémon Database Application

**Feature**: 001-pokemon-database  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Pokémon-themed components
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state (favorites, teams, filters)
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) for API caching and synchronization
- **Charts**: Chart.js with react-chartjs-2 for stat visualizations
- **Icons**: Lucide React for UI icons
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend & Data
- **API**: PokéAPI (pokeapi.co) as primary data source
- **Caching**: Service Worker for offline functionality and API response caching
- **Local Storage**: Browser localStorage for user preferences and favorites
- **Data Processing**: Custom utilities for type effectiveness calculations and stat processing

### Development Tools
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript strict mode
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests

```

### Data Flow
1. **Initial Load**: Fetch Pokémon list from PokéAPI with pagination
2. **Search/Filter**: Client-side filtering with debounced search
3. **Detail View**: Fetch individual Pokémon data on demand
4. **Caching**: TanStack Query handles API response caching
5. **Offline**: Service Worker caches API responses for offline use

### Key Features Implementation

#### 1. Pokémon Grid & Search
- Virtualized grid for performance with large datasets
- Debounced search with fuzzy matching
- Real-time filter application
- Lazy loading of Pokémon images

#### 2. Pokémon Detail View
- Tabbed interface (Stats, Moves, Evolution, Info)
- Interactive stat radar chart
- Type effectiveness matrix
- Evolution tree visualization
- Responsive image gallery

#### 3. Comparison Tool
- Side-by-side stat comparison
- Type effectiveness comparison
- Ability comparison
- Move set comparison

#### 4. Team Builder
- Drag-and-drop team composition
- Team validation (6 Pokémon max)
- Team sharing via URL
- Team export/import

#### 5. Offline Support
- Service Worker for API caching
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Offline indicator
- Cached data management

## API Integration Strategy

### PokéAPI Endpoints
- `/pokemon` - Pokémon list with pagination
- `/pokemon/{id}` - Individual Pokémon details
- `/pokemon-species/{id}` - Species information and evolution data
- `/type` - Type information and effectiveness
- `/move` - Move details and metadata
- `/ability` - Ability information

### Data Processing
- Transform API responses to internal data models
- Calculate derived stats (BST, stat ratings)
- Process type effectiveness relationships
- Handle regional forms and variants
- Generate evolution trees

### Caching Strategy
- Cache Pokémon list for 24 hours
- Cache individual Pokémon data for 7 days
- Cache type effectiveness data indefinitely
- Implement cache invalidation for updates

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques
- Image lazy loading and optimization
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Debounced search and filters
- Code splitting for route-based chunks

### Bundle Size Management
- Tree shaking for unused code
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Image optimization and WebP support
- Minimal external dependencies

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320px - 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1024px+

### Mobile-First Approach
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Optimized image sizes
- Collapsible filter panels

## Accessibility Features

### WCAG Compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Focus indicators
- Alt text for all images

### User Experience
- Loading states and skeletons
- Error boundaries and fallbacks
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Intuitive navigation patterns
