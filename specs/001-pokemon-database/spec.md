# Feature Specification: Pok√©mon Database Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-pokemon-database`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a comprehensive Pok√©mon database application with search, filtering, detailed views, and utility features using Pok√©API"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Pok√©mon enthusiast, I want to browse, search, and explore detailed information about Pok√©mon so that I can learn about their stats, abilities, evolution lines, and build competitive teams.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the main page, **When** I search for "Pikachu", **Then** I see Pikachu's card with basic stats and can click to view details
2. **Given** I want to find Fire-type Pok√©mon, **When** I filter by "Fire" type, **Then** I see all Fire-type Pok√©mon in a grid layout
3. **Given** I am viewing a Pok√©mon detail page, **When** I look at the stats section, **Then** I see a visual chart showing HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed
4. **Given** I want to compare two Pok√©mon, **When** I select the comparison tool, **Then** I can view their stats, types, and abilities side-by-side
5. **Given** I find a Pok√©mon I like, **When** I add it to my favorites, **Then** it appears in my saved favorites list
6. **Given** I want to build a team, **When** I add Pok√©mon to my team builder, **Then** I can save teams of up to 6 Pok√©mon
7. **Given** I am browsing on mobile, **When** I view the application, **Then** the interface adapts to my screen size with touch-friendly interactions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Pok√©API is unavailable? Use Placeholder values.
- How does the system handle Pok√©mon with multiple forms (like Alolan vs regular forms)?
- What happens when a user searches for a Pok√©mon that doesn't exist?
- How does the system handle very large datasets (1000+ Pok√©mon) for performance?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display Pok√©mon in a searchable, filterable grid layout with cards showing sprite, name, ID, and primary type
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide detailed Pok√©mon view with comprehensive information including stats, abilities, evolution line, and moveset
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to search Pok√©mon by name or National Pok√©dex number
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide filtering by type(s), generation, evolution stage, base stat thresholds, color, and egg group
- **FR-005**: System MUST display interactive stat charts (radar or bar graphs) for visual stat comparison
- **FR-006**: System MUST show type effectiveness charts displaying weaknesses, resistances, and immunities
- **FR-007**: System MUST display evolution trees with navigation between related Pok√©mon
- **FR-008**: System MUST organize moveset information by categories: level-up, TM/TR/HM, egg moves, and tutor moves
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to save favorite Pok√©mon and create custom teams of up to 6 Pok√©mon
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide side-by-side comparison tool for stats, typings, and abilities

- **Pok√©mon Stats**: Base stat values (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed) and derived calculations
- **Pok√©mon Types**: Primary and secondary typing with effectiveness relationships
- **Moves**: Individual moves with power, accuracy, type, category, and learning methods
- **Evolution**: Relationships between Pok√©mon showing pre-evolutions and evolutions with conditions
- **User Data**: Favorites, custom teams, and user preferences (theme, filters)
- **Search/Filter State**: Current search terms, active filters, and view preferences
